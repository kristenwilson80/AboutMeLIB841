				I have been married for almost 24 years to my wonderful husband, Bryan. We are empty nesters and seem to collect dogs of all sizes. I mean, you can't just have one can you! We did just recently lost our sweet Cooper. .    ( The dark brown dog in front of me in the photo.) He was 12 years old and was the best dog that you could ever have. Sweet Cooper was a rescue from an animal shelter. 
I assure you, if you ever get the chance to rescue a dog, do it! Our Great Dane is named Marlee, the Chihuahua is named Clover and the Yorkie Mix is named Baylee.

At the time that they started dating, Tucker lived in North Carolina. We are thankful for Tucker, he and Kaitlyn are a wonderful match. He and Kaitlyn dated for 6 years before they got married 2 and a half years ago.

        I also have my own Business. 14 years ago, I started a small photography business as a way to make some extra money. We have truly been blessed. 
        Now, our little business has drastically grown and my daughter and I run the business together! We have a small studio ( the map to get you there is located below) in Irvine, Kentucky close to my house.
