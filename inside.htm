					<p>For the past 11 years, I have been a High School Career and Tecnical Education Family and Consumer Sciences Teacher. I love Career and Technical Education and I love working with my students on ways they can prepare for life. As a CTE teacher, we had a Career and Technical Education Student Organization that we were responsible for. 
					<P>My CTSO was Family, Career and Community Leaders of America, also known as FCCLA.</p>
					
					<p> I had 175 students in my classroom and I taught 7 different classes during the day. I taught the following classes:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Parenting</li>
                        <li>Relationships</li>
                        <li>Foods and Nutrition</li>
                        <li>FACS Essentials 1</li>
                        <li>FACS Essentials 2</li>
                        <li>Money Skills</li>
                        <li>Middle to Late Lifespan Development</li>
                    </ul>

                    

                    <p>Our local chapter of FCCLA was the largest club in the school with 89 members. It was so much fun traveling with these students, holding local events for our community, and watching them compete in FCCLA. In the last two years, thanks to a grant that our school received, we updated our Foods and Nutrition lab and our classroom areas were updated with new storage and new desks. I will be finishing out my year taking two of our students to National FCCLA Competetion in Seattle, Washington. I truly feel that I am ending on a high note. Whatever your position, leave it better than when you started the job. I truly feel that the new teacher is walking into a wonderful program with all the resources that a teacher would need to be successful. </p>

                    <p>This upcoming year is extremely exciting for me!</p>

                    <p>Making the decision to leave my comfortable little world was hard, but I was extremely ready for a change! When I applied for the Librarian Media position at the local middle school, I was informed that the position required teaching two classes a day to students. In the past, this has been a reading intervention class, but the principal wanted me to bring Family and Consumer Sciences classes into the middle school.</p>

					<p>How exciting to do two things that I love! The district has also allowed me to continue being the TEDS/Career and Technical Education Coordinator for our district. Through this position, I get to work with all of the CTE teachers in our district to assist them with funding for their programs and help them build their programs.</p>
